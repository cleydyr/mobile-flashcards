# Readable App
This app has been developed as a requirement for the third module of Udacity's React Nanodegree course. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). This project was designed to work on Android.

## Running the app
First, clone or download the source code. Once you have the code, navigate to the root folder and then run `npm install` to install the dependencies of the project. After the dependencies are installed, you have to run `yarn start` to start the app.
